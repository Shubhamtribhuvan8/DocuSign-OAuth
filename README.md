# DocuSign OAuth 2.0 Integration and Node.js Deployment

This project involves integrating DocuSign OAuth 2.0 authentication into a Node.js application and deploying it for use.

# Description

The project focuses on implementing DocuSign OAuth 2.0 authentication, which allows users to securely authenticate and authorize access to their DocuSign accounts within the application. This integration enables seamless integration with DocuSign APIs to automate document management and e-signature processes.
Additionally, the Node.js application is developed to leverage the DocuSign APIs and provide features such as creating and sending documents for signature, managing envelopes and recipients, and retrieving signed documents. The application utilizes JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, ensuring a consistent and efficient development workflow.

# Features

   1. DocuSign OAuth 2.0 integration for secure user authentication and authorization.
   2. User-friendly interface for interacting with DocuSign features and functionalities.
   3. Ability to create and send documents for signature using DocuSign APIs.
   4. Envelope and recipient management for tracking and monitoring document workflows.
   5. Retrieval of signed documents and integration with downstream processes.

# Technologies

   a. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
   b. Express.js: A popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
   c. DocuSign APIs: Integration with DocuSign's API services for document management and e-signatures.
   d. JavaScript: Used for both front-end and back-end development within the Node.js environment.
   e. HTML/CSS: Used for building the user interface and styling the application.

# Deployment

The Node.js application is deployed using a suitable hosting platform (e.g.Cyclic,Render) to make it accessible over the internet. The deployment process ensures proper configuration and scalability to handle user traffic and maintain the security of the DocuSign integration.
